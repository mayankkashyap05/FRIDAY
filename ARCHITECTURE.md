# Mark 7 architecture

Mark 7 adds the following bounded subsystems:

- `storage.py`: idempotent SQLite migrations, typed preferences, and permissions.
- `plugins.py`: manifest validation, enable/disable state, action declarations, and failure isolation.
- `workflows.py`: cancellable execution, conditions, daily/voice triggers, and run history.
- `ui_automation.py`: accessible element discovery and structured control invocation.
- `screen.py`: privacy-gated local capture and optional cloud visual analysis.
- `knowledge.py`: opt-in Office/PDF extraction, Ollama embeddings, incremental indexing, and cited retrieval.
- `proactive.py`: quiet-hours-aware native notifications, daily workflows, and health warnings.
- `credentials.py` and `user_presence.py`: Windows Credential Manager and Windows Hello boundaries.
- `diagnostics.py`, `recovery.py`, and `updates.py`: install verification, safe backup, and release discovery.

No plugin receives a general shell capability. Plugin manifests declare actions and risk, and every plugin action still passes through `SecureExecutor`. The audit log is hash-chained so later modification is detectable.

The desktop runtime is intentionally split into small layers:

- `Mark_7.py` is the entry point. A second launch raises the running window rather than exiting silently, and `FRIDAY_SELFTEST=1` runs the frozen-build import check instead of starting. `Mark_6.py` remains as a compatibility launcher.
- `friday_os/app.py` owns the Tk desktop UI, tray icon, worker queues, speech output, and confirmations.
- `friday_os/router.py` maps common natural language to typed commands without model involvement. It strips the spoken wake name and politeness first, and exposes `needs_live_information` so the controller can send time-sensitive questions to live sources instead of stale model weights.
- `friday_os/web_research.py` grounds answers using documented public APIs only (SerpAPI when a key is present, otherwise the DuckDuckGo Instant Answer and Wikipedia REST APIs). A failing provider degrades the answer rather than breaking it.
- `friday_os/speech.py` queues speech off the UI thread, preferring Piper or Edge neural voices and falling back to offline SAPI.

The interface is built from a single visual language rather than per-widget colours:

- `theme.py` holds the palette, typography, spacing, and the assistant states. Nothing else defines a colour.
- `widgets.py` supplies the primitives Tk lacks: rounded cards, buttons with hover and press states, status pills, and the input meter, all drawn on canvases.
- `orb.py` is the voice core. It reads live microphone level and deforms with it, so the animation reflects the room instead of running on a timer.
- `audio_level.py` measures input loudness and discards the audio. It never transcribes, and it also supplies the room-tone reading used to calibrate the speech threshold.
- `setup_ui.py` is the first-run wizard; `startup.py` owns the sign-in entry for both the wizard and the settings screen.

Supporting subsystems added alongside:

- `diagnostics_log.py` gives swallowed exceptions somewhere to go. The codebase catches broadly on purpose; without a record, a silent failure looks identical to a missing feature.
- `earcons.py` synthesises short confirmation tones rather than shipping audio files.
- `live_transcribe.py` runs its own VAD and transcribes the audio so far, using a fast model for drafts and an accurate one for the final result.
- `reminders.py` stores reminders in SQLite so they survive a restart, and the proactive loop delivers them.
- `language.py` detects Swahili and rewrites Swahili commands into the English the router already understands, so both languages share one routing path.
- `music.py` controls Spotify through its API, falling back to the media keys.

A single `set_state` call moves the orb, the status chip, the caption, and the session note together, so they cannot disagree about what the assistant is doing.
- `friday_os/actions.py` contains explicit Windows capabilities. It does not expose a general shell tool.
- `friday_os/security.py` applies risk policy and records every local action in SQLite.
- `friday_os/assistant.py` handles Ollama/OpenAI conversation, persistent history, and lazy Whisper input.
- `friday_os/settings.py` loads non-secret behavior and secrets from the untracked `.env` file.

The UI thread never performs model, microphone, or automation work. Background queues keep the window responsive. Sensitive background actions synchronously request confirmation from the UI thread before continuing.

## Extending actions

Add a typed route in `router.py`, implement a handler in `actions.py`, assign `Risk.MEDIUM` or `Risk.HIGH` when user confirmation is appropriate, and add routing/action tests. Do not route model text into `shell=True`, PowerShell, `cmd.exe`, `eval`, or `exec`.
