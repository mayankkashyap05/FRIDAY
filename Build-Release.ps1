#requires -Version 5.1
<#
    Builds the distributable application.

    A frozen build can start and still fail the first time somebody speaks,
    because PyInstaller cannot see imports that happen inside functions. So
    this does not trust a successful build: it runs the frozen application's
    own import check before declaring success.
