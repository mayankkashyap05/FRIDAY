"""Proof that a frozen build can actually do its job.

PyInstaller follows imports statically, and this codebase imports heavy
dependencies inside functions so startup stays fast. That combination produces
builds that launch happily and then fail the first time somebody speaks,
reads the screen, or triggers the wake word.

This imports every one of those lazily-loaded dependencies in the order the
running application would, and reports which are missing. It runs inside the
frozen executable, so it tests the bundle rather than the developer's machine.
