"""Surviving a crash without making it worse.

An assistant that starts with Windows and holds a resident model will
eventually be killed mid-action: a power loss, a forced restart, a hung
driver. Two things then matter. The next start has to know it was not a clean
one, and it must not silently repeat whatever was in flight.

Repeating is the real danger. Re-running a search is harmless; re-running a
delete or a package install is not. So an action is only ever offered for
retry when the registry says it is safe to repeat, and even then the user is
told rather than surprised.
