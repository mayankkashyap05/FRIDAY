"""PyInstaller build for the F.R.I.D.A.Y desktop application.

One-folder rather than one-file: a single executable unpacks to a temporary
directory on every launch, which is the wrong trade for an application that
starts with Windows and holds a resident model.

Several dependencies here load native libraries or read data files at runtime
that PyInstaller cannot see by following imports, so they are collected
explicitly. Getting this wrong produces a build that starts and then fails the
first time somebody speaks, which is why Build-Release.ps1 smoke-tests the
frozen application rather than trusting that it built.
